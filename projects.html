					<img class="w-75 mx-auto d-block" src="img/piglet.png"></img>
					<br /><br />
					<p>This game, created in September 2016, is an Angry Birds-inspired casual strategy shooter where the player controls Piglet on his quest to get revenge against Winnie the Pooh.
					The game was created to satisfy the requirements of an assignment, which included using many of Unity's 2D features, especially its physics engine.
					The game won an in-class prize for best game to come out of this assignment.
					</p>
					<p>My major responsibilities for this project included:
						<ul>
							<li>Developing the user interface</li>
							<li>Developing behavior scripts for the player and various other objects</li>
							<li>Developing the pot-breaking mechanism</li>
							<li>Developing the physics to make the game feel right</li>
						</ul>

					<p>This game, created in Fall 2016, is an RPG-style art game where the player controls a phoenix as it sets about changing the seasons from winter to spring.
					The game was created as a collaboration between three game development students and a game design student from our university, as well as two artists and one animator from a Polish university, to simulate how game development happens in the industry.
					As a game developer, my role was to make the design document come to life on the screen, and although we as a group didn't fulfill all of what the document specified, we managed to create a decent game given the 2 month time constraint.
					</p>
					<p>My major responsibilities for this project included:
						<ul>
							<li>Developing a terrain deformation algorithm for the snow layer</li>
							<li>Developing a randomized procedural tree stand generation algorithm</li>
							<li>Using the phoenix's collider to affect material changes in rocks and leaves</li>
						</ul>

					<p>Between the summer of 2016 and the summer of 2017, I, a fellow student researcher, and our mentor explored the potential for real-time, dynamically-built global illumination lighting systems. 
					We used voxel cone global illumination (VXGI) as our lighting algorithm and stored voxel data in a sparse octree. 
					During the project, we developed a way to update only the parts of the octree that had been changed from frame to frame.
					We got this partially-dynamic system up and running at around 30FPS (on a NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti graphics card) before our mentor moved to a different university and the research project ended.
					</p>
					<p>My major responsibilities for this project included:
						<ul>
							<li>Writing the CPU-side code to set up the scene and direct the GPU's actions</li>
							<li>Developing a highly parallelized algorithm for building an octree using compute shaders</li>
							<li>Writing a highly parallelized algorithm for gathering voxels that had changed between frames using compute shaders</li>
							<li>Developing a triangle-to-points decomposition algorithm using tesselation and geometry shaders</li>
							<li>Debugging the team's code</li>
						</ul>

					<p>This was a Capstone project created in Fall 2017 for a client who wanted to expand his tourism business to include scavenger hunts, as well.
					This web app was developed by 4 computer science majors, each with a different concentration, serving the needs of a client with no technical experience.
					The front-end was developed with ReactJS components and using Javascript code, and the backend was developed as a Flask app and used Python code.
					Communication from front-end to back-end was facilitated by the Socket.IO library, and communication back to the front-end was facilitated by JSON callbacks.
					The project was one of three featured Capstone projects for the semester and earned glowing praise from the client.
					</p>
					<p>My major responsibilities for this project included:
						<ul>
							<li>Developing the registration system and validating form information</li>
							<li>Working with the Stripe API to securely receive money from customers</li>
							<li>Storing all data in the PostgreSQL database and securing sensitive information using SHA-256</li>
							<li>Developing the hunt closing and winner announcement algorithms</li>
						</ul>
